        <h1>About India</h1>
        <p>India, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. It is made up of 28 states and eight union
            territories, and its national capital is New Delhi, Built in the 20th century just south of the historic hub
            of Old Delhi to serve as India's administrative center. Its government is a constitutional republic that
            represents a highly diverse population consisting of thousands of ethnic groups and hundreds of languages.
            India became the world's most populous country in 2023, according to estimates by the United Nations.</p>
        <p>India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich culture heritage.
            It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since Independence. As the 7th largest country in the
            world, India stands apart from the rest of the Asia, marked off as it is by moutains and the sea, which give
            the country a district geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches
            southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bangal on the
            east and the Arabian Sea on the west.</p>
        <h2>10 Customs and Traditions in Indian Culture</h2>
        <p>Our guide is here to show you some of the India's most popular customs and traditions, to give you a feel for
            this amazing country and to learn a little more if you're planning to visit.</p>
        <h2>Greetings</h2>
        <p>One of the most popular customs and traditions in Indian culture is the Namaste greeting, sometimes called
            namaskar or namaskaram, translating as 'i bow to the diving in you'. This respectful way of saying hello,
            goodbye, and thank you has seen a huge uptake around the world during the Coronavirus outbreak as an
            alternative to handshakes and hugs. The gesture is performed by placing the palms together in prayer pose in
            front of the chest, fingers pointing upwards, and making a slight bow.</p>
        <p>Another popular saying is 'Atithi Devo Bhava', a Sanskrit verse from Hindu scriptures that translates as 'the
            guest is equivalent to god'. In Indian culture, guests have always been given supreme importance.</p>
        <p>You might also encounter the Indian head shake which can mean yes, thank you or indicate understanding,
            depending on the context of the conversation.</p>

        <h2>Families</h2>
        <p>It's a family affair for the next of our customs and traditions in Indian culture. A joint family in India is
            where the entire family all live together, which can include parents, wife, childerns and occasionally
            relatives. At the head of the family is a 'karta', a senior male or female who makes economic and social
            decisions on behalf of the entite family, and other retions can be equal, of mutual respect or teasing in
            nature.</p>
        <p>Income Goes into a common pool, which benefits all members. Nowadays, economic development and urbanisation
            have led to an increase in nuclear-like families than joint families.</p>
        <p>Arranged marriage is still strong tradition in India. This dates back to Vedic times in 1500-1100BCE where
            suitable matches from around the kingdom would compete in cometitions to win the hand of a royal bride.</p>

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>One of the favourite custom and tradition in Indian culture is food! Every region in india has its own
            distinct cuisin with a signature dish or ingredient. It's one of the best countries for vegetarian cuisin,
            which you'll find predominantly in Gujarat and Rajasthan. Non-vegetarian option features strongly in
            Bengali, Mughlai, North Indian and Panjabi cuisin, and Kerala in South India is famous for its delicious
            Fish Dishes</p>
        <p>You can always guarantee plenty of fresh ingredient, including wonderful herbs and spices used for flavour,
            aromas, to enhance colours and for healing properties.</p>
        <p>although many restaurants provide cutlery for tourists, it's great to get involved with the Indian tradition
            of eating with your hands. As well as immersing yourself in Indian culture, your digestive system will thank
            you as it means you eat more slowly. Wash your hands thoroughly before and after, and use your right hand to
            eat.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>India is a land where people from different religion coexist harmoniously. 79.8% of the population worship
            Hinduism, 14.2% islam, 2.3% Christianity, 1.7% sikhism, 0.7% Buddhism and 0.4% Jainism.</p>
        <p>The cow is a sacred animal in Hindu culture and is depticted in mythology as accompanying several gods such
            as Shiva on his bull Nandi, or Krishna, the cowherd god. The horns represents the gods, the four legs are
            'vedas' (ancient Hindu scriptures) and the udder is the four objectives of life-desires, material wealth,
            righteousness and salvation. Consuming beef or killing a cow is considered sinful, and it is illegal to
            slaughter a cow in several states.</p>
        <p>Fast ('Vrats' or 'Upavas') are a key part of Indian culture, as a means of giving thanks to Gods and
            Goddesses and of showing resolve and sincerity. It is thought that by going without the necessity of food
            you will cleanse yourself of sin. Fasta are observed through India on various days and on a range of
            religious occasions.</p>

        <h2>Temples</h2>
        <p>Exploring Indian temples is a magical experience, but there are a few things to remember before you visit.
            Many of these sacred buildings were deliberately built at places rich in positive energy from the magnetic
            wave lines of the Earth. Most temples feature one main idol, which has a copper plate called the Garbhagriha
            or Moolasthan underneath that absorbs and resonates this underground energy.</p>
        <p>One of the customs and traditions in Indian culture is to have a bath or shower before entering a temple or
            at least wash your hands and feet to cleanse yourself of negative thoughts and evil influences.</p>
        <p>Appropriate attire is really important, namely conservative clothing to indicate respect. Women should
            ideally wear a modest top and a calf or ankle-length skirt or trousers that will allow sitting comfortably
            cross-legged on the floor. Men should wear trousers and a shirt. Avoid wearing leather or animal skin of any
            kind, as this is offensive to practising Hindus.</p>

        <h2>Festivals</h2>
        <p>Next on our list of customs and traditions in Indian culture is festivals. There are hundreds of celebrations
            to experience in India, meaning that every day holds a new celebration. The huge variety of festivals
            represents India’s rich culture and traditions, with state-wide, religion-based, and community-focused
            festivals on offer.</p>
        <p>Hindus celebrate Diwali, Holi and Makar Sakranti, Muslims observe Eid, Baisakhi (crop harvesting) is a Sikh
            festival, Jains commemorate Mahavir Jayanti and Buddhists mark Buddha's birthday. Christmas and Good Friday
            are celebrated by Christians too. Then there are festivals to honour saints, public figures and gurus.</p>
        <p>Indian festivals can feature ornate idols in extravagant parades, specific food dishes, dancing and music,
            sacred rituals and vibrant colours. There are also well-being, yoga and walking festivals. Unlike many
            festivals around the world which can be boozy affairs, many ‘dry days’ where the sale of alcohol is
            prohibited fall on major national Indian festivals and occasions. Why not incorporate a festival into your
            tour for the chance to be part of community celebrations and create magical holiday memories?

        <h2>Clothing</h2>
        <p>Clothes in India depend on the climate, cultural traditions and ethnicity of each region. Both male and
            female clothing has progressed from simple garments covering the body (sari, dhoti, gamcha, kaupina,
            langota, lungi and loincloths) into intricate costumes used not only in daily wear but also on festive
            occasions, rituals and dance performances. You’ll see western clothing worn by people of all social levels
            in urban areas.</p>
        <p>Traditional Indian clothing often showcases fantastic skills passed down from generations, including
            embroidery, embellishment and printing, as well as ornate textiles such as fine silk. Clothing may be worn
            in particular colours to represent a religion or a particular ritual.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Dancing</h2>
        <p>India offers a wide variety of dance forms which vary throughout each state. The Hindu Sanskrit
            ‘Natyashashtra’ (text of performing arts) recognises eight Indian classical dances, which includes Kathak in
            North, West and Central India, with East India showcasing Sattriya from Assam, Manipuri from Manipur and
            Oddisi from Odhisa. In South India, you can witness the Kuchipudi in Andhra Pradesh, Bharatnatyam in Tamil
            Nadu, Kathakali and Mohiniyattam in Kerala.</p>
        <p>These dance forms have dramatic narratives, with performers telling stories mostly from mythology through
            gestures and movement.</p>
        <p>Indian folk dances are also based on stories, this time passed down through generations. These dances are
            popular in rural areas with performances showing the everyday life of villagers.</p>

        <h2>Literature</h2>
        <p>India has many great epics dating back many centuries in the form of stories, poems, plays and self-help
            guides. The two most famous Hindu epics are the Ramayana and Mahabharata, which both contain thrilling tales
            of gods and demons, love and war and chariots and kidnappings. These stories have been told and retold for
            thousands of years and play a huge part in the customs and traditions in Indian culture.</p>
        <p>The Ramayana tells the story of Rama, prince of the legendary kingdom of Kosala, and follows his
            fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha. The Mahabharata is the longest poem
            that has been written in Sanskrit. Both epics tell of good triumphing over evil and show the values of
            devotion, loyalty, sacrifice and truth.</p>

        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>India is a land of many fascinating languages and dialects which can change even within a few miles. there
            are more than 19,500 mother tongues, 415 living languages, and 23 constitutionally recognised official
            languages in India. Hindi is spoken by 41% of the population, particualrly in the north, and 12% of Indians
            can speak English as a second language.</p>
        <p>Many people living in India write in the Devanagari script, developed between the 1st and 4th centuries. The
            script contains 47 primary characters including 14 vowels and 33 consonants and is written from left to
            right. The characters have symmetrical rounded shapes within squared outlines and are all written in the
            same case, without any capitalisation.</p>

        <p>India, a land of unparalleled diversity, boasts a history as rich and varied as its landscapes. From the
            ancient Indus Valley Civilization to the vibrant cultural tapestry of modern India, this nation has been a
            cradle of human civilization. As we journey through the annals of time, we will explore the empires that
            rose and fell, the philosophies that flourished, and the remarkable individuals who left an indelible mark
            on history. Join us as we unravel the story of India, a story of resilience, innovation, and enduring
            legacy.</p>
        <p>India's history is a tapestry woven with threads of diverse cultures, languages, and religions. This
            diversity has shaped its historical narrative, making it one of the most fascinating and complex histories
            in the world. The geographical diversity, from the towering Himalayas to the vast Thar Desert, has also
            played a significant role in shaping the country's history.</p>
        <h2>Ancient History</h2>
        <p>The History of India begins with the Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two phases
            are generally described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic periods. The earliest literary source that sheds light on
            India's past is the Rig Veda. It is difficult to date this work with any accuracy on the basis of tradition
            and ambiguous astronomical information contained in the hymns. Indus valley civilization, which flourished
            between 2800 BC and 1800 BC, had an advanced and flourishing economic system. The Indus valley people
            practiced agriculture, domesticated animals, made tools and weapons from copper, bronze, and tin and even
            traded with some Middle East countries.</p>
        <h2>The Indus Valley Civilization</h2>
        <p>A long time ago, in the eastern world, there rose a few civilizations. The main reasons for the rise of these
            urban civilizations were access to rivers, which served various functions of human beings. Along with the
            Mesopotamian civilization and the Egyptian civilization, rose the Indus Valley civilization spanning
            Northwest India and modern-day Pakistan. The largest amongst the three civilizations, the Indus Valley
            civilization flourished around 2600 BC, at which time agriculture in India started flourishing. The fertile
            Indus valley made it possible for agriculture to be carried out on a large scale. The most well-known towns
            of the Indus Valley in today’s date are Mohenjo Daro and Harappa. Unearthing these two towns showed
            excavators glimpses into the richness of the Indus Valley civilization, evidenced in ruins and things like
            household articles, war weapons, gold and silver ornament - and so on. The people of the Indus Valley
            civilization lived in well-planned towns and well-designed houses made of baked bricks. In an era of
            developments and prosperity, civilization, unfortunately, came to an end by around 1300 BC, mainly due to
            natural calamities.
        </p>
        <h2>Vedic Civilization</h2>
        <p>The next era that India saw was that of the Vedic civilization, flourishing along the river Saraswati, named
            after the Vedas, which depict the early literature of the Hindus. The two greatest epics of this period were
            the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, still held in great reverence by the followers of Hinduism. </p>
        <h2>Buddhist Era</h2>
        <p>Next came the Buddhist era, during the time of the Mahajanapadas which were the sixteen great powers, during
            the 7th and the 6th centuries BC. Prominent powers at the time were the Sakyas of Kapilavastu and the
            Licchavis of Vaishali. Buddha, whose original name was Siddhartha Gautam, was born in Lumbini near
            Kapilavastu and was the founder of Buddhism - a religion based on spiritualism. He died at the age of 80 in
            480 BC but his teachings spread throughout southern and eastern Asia and are followed across the world
            today. </p>
        <h2>The Invasion of Alexander</h2>
        <p>When Alexander invaded India in 326 BC, he crossed the Indus river and defeated the Indian rulers in battle.
            Noteworthy of the Indians’ attempts at war, was the use of elephants, something that the Macedonians had
            never seen before. Alexander then took over the lands of the defeated kings.</p>
        <h2>The Gupta Dynasty</h2>
        <p>The Gupta period has been referred to as the Golden Age of Indian history. When Chandragupt I received the
            gift of Pataliputra in dowry when he married the daughter of the chief of the ‘Licchavis’, he started to lay
            down the foundation of his empire, which extended from the river Ganges or the Ganga to the city of
            Allahabad. He ruled for 15 years and was also referred to as the ‘king of kings’ for his strategic conquests
            and the flourishing state of India. </p>
        <h2>Harshavardhana</h2>
        <p>The last of the ancient kingdoms in India was by the king Harshavardhana, who ascended the throne at
            Thanneshwar and Kannauj after his brother died. While successful in a few of his conquests, he eventually
            got defeated by the Chalukya Kingdom of Deccan India. Harshavardhana was well-known for establishing
            relations with the Chinese, and also for having high religious tolerance and strong administrative
            capabilities. </p>
        <h2>Medieval Indian History</h2>
        <p>The medieval history of India is renowned for deriving a lot of its character from Islamic kingdoms.
            Extending across almost three generations, medieval India included a number of kingdoms and dynasties: <br>
        <p>- The Chalukyas</p>
        <p>- The Pallavas</p>
        <p>- The Pandyas</p>
        <p>- The Rashtrakutas</p>
        <p>- The Cholas</p>


        <br>
        <p>The Cholas were the most important rulers at this time, the 9th Century AD. Their kingdom covered a large
            part of South India, including Sri Lanka and the Maldives. While the rulers ruled bravely and carried out
            the annexation of multiple territories in India, the empire came to an end in the 14th Century AD with an
            invasion by a man named Kafur Malik. The monuments from the Chola Dynasty are still intact and are known for
            their rustic charm. </p>


        <br>
        <p>The next major empire was that of the Mughals, preceded by a rise in Islamic rulers. The invasion of Timur
            was a significant point in Indian history before a Hindu revival movement called the Bhakti movement, came
            to be. Finally, in the 16th Century, the Mughal empire started to rise. One of the greatest empires of
            India, the Mughal empire was a rich and glorious one, with the whole of India united and ruled by one
            monarch. The Mughal Kings were Babar, Humayun, Sher Shah Suri (not a Mughal king), Akbar, Jehangir, Shah
            Jahan, and Aurangzeb. They were responsible for setting up efficient public administration, laying out
            infrastructure, and promoting the arts. A large number of monuments in India today exist from the Mughal
            period. The death of the last Mughal King, Aurangzeb, sowed the seeds of disintegration within India.
            Influencers of Islamic architecture in India, the Mughal kings are still looked back in awe. </p>
        </p>
        <h2>Akbar</h2>
        <p>Emperor Akbar, also known as Akbar the Great or Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar, was the third emperor of the
            Mughal Empire, after Babur and Humayun. He was the son of Nasiruddin Humayun and succeeded him as the
            emperor in the year 1556 when he was only 13 years old.
        </p>
        <h2>Shah Jahan</h2>
        <p>Shah Jahan, also known as Shahbuddin Mohammed Shah Jahan, was a Mughal Emperor who ruled in the Indian
            Subcontinent from 1628 to 1658. He was the fifth Mughal ruler, after Babur, Humayun, Akbar, and Jahangir.
            Shah Jahan succeeded the throne after revolting against his father, Jahangir.</p>
        <h2>Chhatrapati Shivaji</h2>
        <p>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is considered to be one
            of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a part of the
            folklore. King Shivaji used the guerrilla tactics to capture a part of, the then, dominant Mughal empire.
        </p>
        <h2>Modern Indian History</h2>
        <p>During the late 16th and the 17th Centuries, the European trading companies in India competed with each other
            ferociously. By the last quarter of the 18th Century, the English had outdone all others and established
            themselves as the dominant power in India. The British administered India for a period of about two
            centuries and brought about revolutionary changes in the social, political and economic life of the country.
        </p><br>

        <p>The zenith of colonisation was achieved when the British arrived in the early 1600s as traders. Capitalizing
            on the disintegration that existed in India after the Mughal rule, the British actively used the strategy of
            ‘divide-and-rule’ to rule over India for over 2 centuries. While the British had come in earlier, they only
            achieved political power in 1757 AD after the Battle of Plassey. </p><br>

        <p> Took a keen interest in the resources that India had to offered and have been looked back at as plunderers
            of India’s wealth of resources - as they took cotton, spices, silk, and tea, amongst numerous other
            resources. While they did lay out a massive chunk of India’s infrastructure, by also bringing the Indians
            steam engines, it is seldom looked back at as an equal relationship. The British Raj was divisive and pit
            Indians against one another, on the basis of religion; and also mistreated the laborers. The Indians were
            essentially slaves of the British rule and were working hard without any returns on their work. This,
            naturally, led to multiple mutinies; and prominent freedom fighters came to the forefront. Different
            ideologies of thought believed that there were different ways of gaining freedom; however, they all had one
            common goal - freedom.</p> <br>

        <p> British queen had asserted that the aim of the British was to help India progress - however, multiple
            problems arose without the consultation of Indian leaders. One important instance of this was when in the
            First World War, Britain launched an attack on Germany on behalf of India, even though India did not wish
            for that to happen; and millions of Indian soldiers were at the forefront of the British Indian Army during
            both the world wars - further fuelling the Indian resistance. Over a million Indian soldiers were killed in
            both the World Wars.
